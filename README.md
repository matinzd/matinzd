## Hi everyone 👋
My name is Matin and I work as a full-time Mobile Application Engineer.

## My summary
I have solid experience maintaining mobile applications for both iOS and Android platforms, and I manage several open-source projects and libraries. In addition to working with high-level programming languages, I am also interested in low-level technologies and robotics. I'm motivated to keep learning and improving in these areas and look forward to new challenges. In my free time, I enjoy reading, playing ping pong, and listening to music.

## Projects
Here are some of the projects that I am currently maintaining:

- [Lottie React Native](https://github.com/lottie-react-native/lottie-react-native)
- [React Native Health Connect](https://github.com/matinzd/react-native-health-connect)
