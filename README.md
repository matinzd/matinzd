## Hi everyone 👋
My name is Matin and I work as a full-time Mobile Application Engineer.

## My summary
I have a strong background in maintaining mobile applications for both iOS and Android platforms and maintain some of my open source projects/libraries. In addition to my experience with high-level programming languages, I am also deeply interested in low-level technologies and robotics. I am highly motivated to expand my skills and knowledge in these areas and eager to take on new challenges in the field. In my spare time, I read books, play ping pong and listen to music.

## Projects
Here are some of the projects that I am currently maintaining:

- [Lottie React Native](https://github.com/lottie-react-native/lottie-react-native)
- [React Native Health Connect](https://github.com/matinzd/react-native-health-connect)
